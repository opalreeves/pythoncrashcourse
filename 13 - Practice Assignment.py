# Be sure you went through each of the scripts and understood most of what you encountered, because you'll need several of the skills that you aquired to solve this assignment.


# your goal:
# add code to the function below.
# The code has a parameter called num
# The goal of the function is to return a list with every EVEN number from 0 until one less than num.

def even_numbers(num):
    # num is a positive integer greater than zero
    # return a list of all even integers from 0 until 1 less than the number
    # For example, if the number is 6, return [0,2,4]
    
    # write your code here    

    # replace the return value your even number list
    return []



# DO NOT CHANGE ANY CODE BELOW HERE

# When you are ready to test your fuction, save your code and run the script. The output will show if you passed or failed each of the tests.
# Your goal is to pass all of the tests.

# These are test cases which will run agaist your code
